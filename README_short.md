# What is HAProxy?

HAProxy is the fastest and most widely used open-source load balancer and application delivery controller. Written in C, it has a reputation for efficient use of both processor and memory. It can proxy at either layer 4 (TCP) or layer 7 (HTTP) and has additional features for inspecting, routing and modifying HTTP messages.

It comes bundled with a web UI, called the HAProxy Stats page, that you can use to monitor error rates, the volume of traffic and latency. Features can be toggled on by updating a single configuration file, which provides a syntax for defining routing rules, rate limiting, access controls, and more.

Other features include:

- SSL/TLS termination
- Gzip compression
- Health checking
- HTTP/2
- gRPC support
- Lua scripting
- DNS service discovery
- Automatic retries of failed conenctions
- Verbose logging

# How to use this image

This image is being shipped with a trivial sample configuration and for any real life use it should be configured according to the [extensive documentation](https://docs.haproxy.org/) and [examples](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/tree/master/examples). We will now show how to override shipped haproxy.cfg with one of your own.

## Create a `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM haproxytech/haproxy-debian-quic:3.0
COPY haproxy.cfg /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

## Build the container

```console
$ docker build -t my-haproxy .
```

## Test the configuration file

```console
$ docker run -it --rm my-haproxy haproxy -c -f /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

## Run the container

```console
$ docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy my-haproxy
```

You will also need to publish the ports your HAProxy is listening on to the host by specifying the `-p` option, for example `-p 8080:80` to publish port 8080 from the container host to port 80 in the container.

## Use volume for configuration persistency

```console
$ docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy -v /path/to/etc/haproxy:/usr/local/etc/haproxy:ro haproxytech/haproxy-debian-quic:3.0
```

Note that your host's `/path/to/etc/haproxy` folder should be populated with a file named `haproxy.cfg` as well as any other accompanying files local to `/etc/haproxy`.

## Reloading config

To be able to reload HAProxy configuration, you can send `SIGUSR2` to the container:

```console
$ docker kill -s USR2 my-running-haproxy
```

## Enable Data Plane API

[Data Plane API](https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/hapee/2-7r1/api/data-plane-api/) sidecar is being distributed by default in all 2.0+ images and to enable it there are a few steps required:

1. define one or more users through `userlist`
2. enable dataplane api process through `program api`
3. enable haproxy.cfg to be read/write mounted in Docker, either by defining volume being r/w or by rebuilding image with your own haproxy.cfg
4. expose dataplane TCP port in Docker with `--expose`

Relevant part of haproxy.cfg is below:

```
userlist haproxy-dataplaneapi
    user admin insecure-password mypassword

program api
   command /usr/bin/dataplaneapi --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5555 --haproxy-bin /usr/sbin/haproxy --config-file /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg --reload-cmd "kill -SIGUSR2 1" --restart-cmd "kill -SIGUSR2 1" --reload-delay 5 --userlist haproxy-dataplaneapi
   no option start-on-reload
```

To run such image we would use the following command (note that volume containing haproxy.cfg is mounted r/w and port tcp/5555 is being exposed):

```console
$ docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy --expose 5555 -v /path/to/etc/haproxy:/usr/local/etc/haproxy:rw haproxytech/haproxy-debian-quic
```
